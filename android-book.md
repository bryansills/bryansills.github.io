# Android Programming: The Big Nerd Ranch Guide (5th Edition)

I helped write the 5th edition of Big Nerd Ranch's Android Programming book.
It was originally released in May of 2022, but as of June 2025, it is still a solid resource for learning modern Android development practices.
Big Nerd Ranch was acquired by Amdocs in 2020 and since then, Amdocs has slowly shuttered the Big Nerd Ranch brand and business.

As a part of shuttering the Big Nerd Ranch brand, Amdocs took down the [bignerdranch.com](https://bignerdranch.com) website and broke the links where book readers could download the solutions for the books.
I have uploaded those solutions here to my personal website for readers to use.

Unfortunately, there are no plans for a 6th edition of the Android Programming book at this time.
Thank you for reading the book.
